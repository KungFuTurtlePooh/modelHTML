    <p>Tenorflow: Tensorflow is a machine learning library which makes it easier to create a trained AI.  When creating the brain of the AI, there are many different ways to approach it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>CNN:  One way to approach image classification is by using Convolutional Neural Network.  How this works is that you have 2 different types of layers: Conv2d and pooling2d.  The purpose of the conv2D layer is to highlight possible patterns on the image.  While the pooling2d layer helps reduce the size of the image to make it easier for the AI to process.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What the AI can Predict:  Currently, the AI can predict 4 anime characters.  How it predicts the character is by going through the Neural Network we created.  When going through the neural network, the AI looks at the patterns of the pixels.  It goes through all of the layers and at the end, each character has a different weight assigned to them.  The highest weight is the one the AI predicts.</p>
